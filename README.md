# lexicon

Small and simple project to try out TypeScript and to better my (and your?) vocabulary.

## Development & Running locally

Should be as simple as:

    $ npm i
    $ rollup -c -w
    $ php -S localhost:8080 # feel free to use something else to serve

## Running in production

Just drop the files in some accessable path and you should be good to go.

## Features to add at some point

- Part of speech (verb, noun, adjective, adverb)
- UI and UX improvements
- Animations
- Clean up & revise the code
- Automated testing
- GitHub Pages support
- More words
